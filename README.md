# Mars-Orbiter-Game
This is a description for my project Mars Orbiter Game.
##
The project has been made with the help of pygame module. The first objective of the game is to convert your orbit around mars from an elliptical shape to as circular as possible (accepted winning value for orbital eccentricity is <0.05) and the second objective is to reduce the altitude of your orbit to a lower value but not too low otherwise the satellite will burn and crash in the atmosphere of mars.
